### Source Code

```
I saw an article yesterday that was talking about parallel port programming in visual basic. However, this artical didn't contain any code nor did it really inform you as to much of anything about programming the parallel port. So, I wrote this short tutorial to introduce you to the basics of programming the parallel port. </p>
I plan on writing more advanced tutorials at a later date but this should get you started.
